# AWS CRUD Application

![Demo](https://github.com/ali20021973/CloudAWS/blob/main/demo/Screenshot%20(109).png)

## Overview

This project is a cloud-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built on AWS, leveraging various AWS services and modern technologies. It includes a backend using AWS Lambda and MongoDB, and a frontend hosted on an EC2 instance.

## Technologies Used

### AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is used to run our backend code without provisioning or managing servers. It automatically scales our application by running code in response to triggers such as HTTP requests via API Gateway.

### MongoDB

MongoDB is our database of choice for its flexibility and scalability. It's a NoSQL database, meaning it stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, making it easy to handle varied data structures.

### React

Our frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows us to create reusable UI components and manage the application state efficiently.

### AWS EC2

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is used to host our React application. EC2 provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS cloud, allowing us to deploy and manage our application easily.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS account
- Node.js installed
- MongoDB Atlas account

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aws-crud-app.git
   cd aws-crud-app/backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure `serverless.yml` with your AWS credentials and MongoDB URI.

4. Deploy the backend:

   ```bash
   serverless deploy
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the React app:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Host the React app on EC2:

   - Launch an EC2 instance from the AWS Management Console.
   - SSH into the instance and install Nginx:

     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install nginx
     ```

   - Copy the build files to the EC2 instance:

     ```bash
     scp -r build/* ec2-user@your-ec2-instance-ip:/var/www/html
     ```

   - Restart Nginx:

     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart nginx
     ```

5. Access your application via the EC2 instance's public IP.


## Conclusion

This AWS CRUD application demonstrates how to leverage AWS services like Lambda and EC2, along with MongoDB and React, to build a scalable, cloud-based application. Feel free to explore the code, make changes, and deploy your own version!
